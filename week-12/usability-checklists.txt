# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.https://stayintech.com/info/UX
2.http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/guidelines.html

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. If the site is large, the home page contains a search input box
2. The value proposition is clearly stated on the home page
3. Navigation choices are ordered in the most logical or task-oriented manner
4. By just looking at the home page, the first time user will understand where to start.
5. The home page of the site has a memorable URL.
6. Logged in user's name is displayed on the site.
7. Company location and contact information is easily accessible from the homepage. 
8. Images and videos are relevant and meaningful.
9. Site URL works with or without www. For example "www.stayintech.com" and "stayintech.com".
10. Product categories are provided and clearly visible on the homepage.
