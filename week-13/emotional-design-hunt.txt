# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: This coin purse looks like hand-made one. and it looks a little old. it has a coppered zipper which is used when I open the purse. and the shape is half circle. 

* Behavioral: This coin purse can store a lots of coin as well as card. In United State, I prefer to use it to store my coins, paper money and debit cards instead of regular purse. It's most portable thing to store cash for me.

* Reflective: This coin purse is my treasure because my father give me it before leaving my home town. Whenever I use it, I always remind father's love to me.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Element of emotional design can provoke positive emotional reaction from users.
2. The Element should be easy to use (or should include the instructions)
3. The Element should be portable or easy to access.
